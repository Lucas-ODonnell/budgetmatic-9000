I will edit this once the app is complete.

My objective for this app is to make an spa app that sets things up by month as default.

You will be able to input names and prices of things like groceries, income, rent/mortgage, other things you bought, entertainment you spent money on such as restaurants or movies. You will be able to look at the data as bar graphs or pie charts to see what percentage of your monthly budget is going to different things. 

You will be able to look at spending trends such as 3 months spending trends, 6 months spending trends, etc. 

You will be able to choose a previous month if you want to look at that data instead of the current month which is the default.
